The Floppy Game
==========================

Try to dodge/shield against the bullets while killing enemies.
Shielding from bullets and firing lasers increases your ships heat.

If your ship overheats it will no longer be able to move.
If your ship runs out of energy it will not be able to shield or fire.
The ship cannot shield and vent heat at the same time.

Energy is measured by the purple bars, while heat is measured by the orange.
The game currently only has two levels in it.
